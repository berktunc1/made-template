This project explores the relationship between CO2 emissions and population growth of the countries.
Analysing the relationship between CO2 emissions and population growth of countries is crucial as it
helps identify the impact of population dynamics on environmental sustainability, guiding policy
decisions for emission reductions.

## Project Summary
I analyzed countries with the lowest CO2 emission increases relative to their population growth by calculating population growth and CO2 emission increase from 1990 to 2020 using specific formulas. Then, I compared and ranked the countries based on the ratio of CO2 emission growth to population growth.

## Conclusions
Countries at the top of the list likely benefit from a combination of proactive environmental
policies, technological innovation, public engagement in sustainability and favorable economic
structures that collectively contribute to managing CO2 emissions growth despite demographic
changes. However, to give a direct answer to our main question, we need better ways to calculate
population growth and CO2 emission increase.

## Usage
1- Download project/pipeline.py. Edit file -> instead of :memory:, specify a path for the datasets.
For instance: C:/Users/username/Desktop/co2.sqlite and C:/Users/username/Desktop/population.sqlite

2- Run the pipeline.py using project/pipeline.sh <br>
Datasets are ready for the analysis.<br>
